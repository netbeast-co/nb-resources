A Node.js implementation of the [LIFX protocol](https://github.com/LIFX/lifx-protocol-docs). Developed to work with a minimum firmware version of 2.0.

This library is not, in any way, affiliated or related to LiFi Labs, Inc.. Use it at your own risk.

## Installation

```sh
$ npm install node-lifx --save
```

## Compatibility

Node.js 0.12+ and io.js are tested and supported on Mac, Linux and Windows.

## Usage
The file `cli.js` contains a working example.

### Client
The library uses a client for network communication. This client handles communication with all lights in the network.
```js
var LifxClient = require('node-lifx').Client;
var client = new LifxClient();

client.init();
```
The `Client` object is an EventEmitter and emmits events whenever any changes occur. This can be a new light discovery, a light sending a message or similar.  
The client starts discovery of lights right after it is initialized with the `init` method. If a new light is found the client emmits a `light-new` event. This event contains the light as an object on which methods can be called then:

```js
var LifxClient = require('node-lifx').Client;
var client = new LifxClient();

client.on('light-new', function(light) {
  // Change light state here
});

client.init();
```

### Changing light state
The states of a light can be changed with different methods:

#### `light.on([duration])`  
This turns a light on. If the `duration` (in milliseconds) is given it will be faded on over the time.

#### `light.off([duration])`  
This turns a light off. If the `duration` (in milliseconds) is given it will be faded off over the time.

#### `light.color(hue, saturation, brightness, [kelvin], [duration])`  
Changes the color off a light to the given value.  
`hue` is given as number between 0 and 360. The represents the color hue in degree which changes the color.  
`saturation` is given as number between 0 and 100, representing the color intensitity from 0% to 100%.  
`brightness` is given as number between 0 and 100, representing the light brightness from 0% to 100%.  
`kelvin` if given as number between 2500 and 9000, representing the color temperature. The default value is 3500 if not given.  
`duration` if given (in milliseconds) it will fade the color to the new value over time.  
Examples: `light.color(0, 100, 50)` is red at 50% brightness. `light.color(50, 50, 80)` is a light green at 80% brightness.

### Requesting light state and info
Infos of the state and spec of the light can be requested with the following methods:

#### `light.getState(callback)`
Requests general info from a light, this includes color, label and power state. This function is asynchronous. The callback will be provided with two parameters for error and the requested data use `function(error, data) {}`.

#### `light.getFirmwareVersion(callback)`
Requests the firmware version from a light (minor and major version). This function is asynchronous. The callback will be provided with two parameters for error and the requested data use `function(error, data) {}`.

#### `light.getHardwareVersion(callback)`
Requests the hardware version from a light (vendor, product and version). This function is asynchronous. The callback will be provided with two parameters for error and the requested data use `function(error, data) {}`.

### Target a light
To get a specific light the `client.light` method can be used. It expects an identifier as first parameter, this can be the lights ip address `client.light('192.168.2.102')` or the light id `client.light('0123456789012')`. The light returned can then be used to call methods on it. For example `client.light('192.168.2.102').on()`.

### Get all known lights
All active lights will be returned as array when calling `client.lights()`. Each object can then be used to individually call methods on it. To get all lights call `client.lights('')` and to find all inactive lights call `client.lights('off')`.

### Client events
The following events might be thrown by the client.

#### `light-new`
This event is thrown when there is a new light discovery that has not been seen at runtime before. This event is provided with the new light object.  
`client.on('light-new', function(light) {});`

#### `light-offline`
This event is thrown when a light hasn't been discovered for a time. The light given is no longer expected to be reachable.  
`client.on('light-offline', function(light) {});`

#### `light-online`
This event is thrown when a light is discovered again after being offline.
`client.on('light-online', function(light) {});`

### Start / Stop discovery
The discovery for each client can be started and stopped at runtime using these commands:

#### `client.startDiscovery()`
Starts the discovery process.

#### `client.stopDiscovery()`
Stops the discovery process.

### Client settings
For the initialization of the client different settings can be provided. This is an example with the default options:

```js
var LifxClient = require('node-lifx').Client;
var client = new LifxClient();

// ...

client.init({
  lightOfflineTolerance: 3, // A light is offline if not seen for the given amount of discoveries
  messageHandlerTimeout: 45000, // in ms, if not answer in time an error is provided to get methods
  startDiscovery: true, // start discovery after initialization
  debug: false // logs all messages in console if turned on 
});
```
